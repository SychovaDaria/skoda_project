# Guys 
archive contains photos of mobile phones for model. Saved model is in .h5 file. Model is not correct but it should work, tensor.py uses the model and suppose to turn on a stream and if it sees mobile phone it should take a photo. 

You also can write here notes so all of us know what do we do :)

# raspicam module
I created a docstr repo for documentation, most of the information about the module is in the raspicam.html file (exported docstrings). In short, the module can:
- drive the raspberry camera module, or an USB camera
- use different settings (all are saved as atributes)
- collect pictures in form of numpy array
- save pictures in the desired folder
