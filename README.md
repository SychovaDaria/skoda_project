# Guys 
archive contains photos of mobile phones for model. Saved model is in .h5 file. Model is not correct but it should work, tensor.py uses the model and suppose to turn on a stream and if it sees mobile phone it should take a photo. 

You also can write here notes so all of us know what do we do :)
